# Protocol-Fuzzer
This is a protocol fuzzing framework.
To use it effectively, you will need to modify the configuration file according to your specific environment or target product.
For example, replace placeholders such as IP_ADDRESS, ACCOUNT, and PASSWORD with actual values relevant to your system.

⚠️ Note: Ensure that sensitive credentials are not hardcoded if sharing or storing the modified file.
