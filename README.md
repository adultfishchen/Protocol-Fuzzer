# Protocol-Fuzzer

This is a protocol fuzzing framework built for testing custom network protocols.

To use it effectively, you need to modify the configuration file to suit your specific environment or target product.  
For example, update placeholders such as `IP_ADDRESS`, `ACCOUNT`, and `PASSWORD` with actual values relevant to your system.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Avoid hardcoding sensitive credentials when sharing or storing modified files.
